# Boot the system
If no joystick is plugged in you will get no screen, but as soon you plug it in, the select Game menu will start up.

For the game selection you can move around with the joystick and you can start a game with the enter key.
The game you are "hovering" on is displayed colored, and the rest is in diffrent shades of gray.
